# MiniPasta CFW by Team Pasta

### Disclaimer
This is completely Team Pastas work without any of my involvement. I only started this Github repo so that we have an easy place to collaborate and download. Also, see this thread GBAtemp.net: https://gbatemp.net/threads/need-hax-2-x-pasta-loader.400752/

### What is this good for?
This is a minimalic CFW for the Nintendo 3DS console. It works only via Homebrew Launcher on Firmware versions <= 9.2. It has no EmuNAND, no unneccesary patches, no nothing except signature patching. This is not meant for daily use, but rather for some specific operations.
