# MiniPasta CFW by zoogie

### Disclaimer
This is completely zoogies work without any of my involvement. I only started this Github repo so that we have an easy place to collaborate and download.

### What is this good for?
This is a minimalic CFW for the Nintendo 3DS console. It works only via Homebrew Launcher on Firmware versions <= 9.2. It has no EmuNAND, no unneccesary patches, no nothing except signature patching. This is not meant for daily use, but rather for some specific operations.
